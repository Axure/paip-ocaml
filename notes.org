#+TITLE: Notes for the book Paradigms of Artificial Programming, Norvig

* Chapter 4: GPS

** Section 4.3 - State 3: Implementation

The GPS code in this section relies on sets being represented as lists, and 
thus maintaining some kind of order. If we represent sets with structures 
that don't keep items in the order of insertion, the goal "give shop money" 
in the school example can be achieved right at the start of the example if 
the "have money" condition is present. This seems wrong, but is valid if the 
only precondition for goal "give shop money" is "have money", as it is in 
the book. 


** Section 4.13 - The Maze Searching Domain

The problem is represented in a way to find the path in the example 
without any backtracking. GPS does not do backtracking.
