(* 

We need to form lists [executing; stuff] with actions, so maybe we'll 
need to declare actions as symbols after all.   

*)

(* Compile with ocamlc -I .. ../symbol.mli ../symbol.ml gps1.ml *)

(** A set of symbols *) 
module SymbolSet = Set.Make(struct type t = Symbol.symbol
                                   let compare = Symbol.compare end)

(** The type for a state condition *)
type statecond = Symbol of Symbol.symbol | Exec of string | Start

(** A set of state conditions *)
module CondSet = Set.Make(struct type t = statecond
                                 let compare = compare end)

let remove_if fn l = List.filter (fun x -> not (fn x)) l
